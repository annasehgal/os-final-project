# os-final-project
Rust vs C multi-threaded comparison

# Questions explored:
1. Matrix Multiplication
   - Threads compute parts of large matrices in parallel to measure performance.
3. Monte Carlo Simulation
   - Threads simulate random sampling to estimate pi, testing CPU-bound scaling.
4. Anomaly Detector (inspired by the recent NCL challenge)
   - Threads scan image data to detect hidden patterns or anomalies in parallel.
